# FEM_Runoff_Model
Rainfall-runoff model using finite elements-based numerical modeling.
A Water Resources Engineering M.Sc project.

A numerical, approximate solution to kinematic wave equation (transient, 2-dimensional) using the Method of Weighted Residuals (Galerkin, lumped) to compute surface runoff of a watershed.

Development ongoing using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (MSBuild) with MSVC++17, on Windows 10 21H2. Setup targeting primarily x64 environment.
GUI is handled by dear-IMGUI, rendering backend is OpenGL 3.3 (GLFW and GLEW).
